        <p>The heart has little irony in the late afternoon
            Carnal secrets on the surface of the skin
            skinny poems, just waiting
            
            Life refuses to carry itself off to the hills
            holes dug by weasels
            grass flowering
            
            In the pool the heart has almost no breath left
            In the yards it fires wet
            In closed rooms it avoids car horns
            
            Life is put in charge of the windows
            But it ends up plummeting in a rush
            It does not fit Gives no support Is weightless></p>
