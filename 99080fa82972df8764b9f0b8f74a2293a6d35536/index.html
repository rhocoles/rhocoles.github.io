            The heart has little irony in the late afternoon<br/>
            Carnal secrets on the surface of the skin<br/>
            skinny poems, just waiting<br/>
            <br/>
            Life refuses to carry itself off to the hills<br/>
            holes dug by weasels<br/>
            grass flowering<br/>
            <br/>
            In the pool the heart has almost no breath left<br/>
            In the yards it fires wet<br/>
            In closed rooms it avoids car horns<br/>
            <br/>
            Life is put in charge of the windows<br/>
            But it ends up plummeting in a rush<br/>
            It does not fit Gives no support Is weightless
